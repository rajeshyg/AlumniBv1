# Mobile-First React Application

This is a production-ready React application designed with mobile-first principles and easy portability to React Native.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

- **UI Layer** (`src/components/`): Presentational components
- **Business Logic Layer** (`src/hooks/`, `src/store/`): Custom hooks and state management
- **Data Layer** (`src/lib/`, `src/api/`): API calls and data handling

### Key Features

- Push notifications support
- Responsive layout
- Error boundaries
- Lazy loading
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Performance optimizations

## React Native Migration Guide

To port this application to React Native:

1. **Components to Adapt**:
   - Replace HTML elements with React Native components
   - Update style properties to RN compatible ones
   - Use React Native's Platform-specific components

2. **Libraries to Replace**:
   - Replace `react-router-dom` with `@react-navigation/native`
   - Update notification implementation for mobile
   - Replace web-specific APIs with React Native equivalents

3. **Styling Changes**:
   - Convert Tailwind classes to StyleSheet
   - Update layout to use Flexbox properly
   - Handle platform-specific styling

4. **API/Services**:
   - Update storage mechanism (AsyncStorage)
   - Implement native push notifications
   - Handle deep linking

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Best Practices

- Use platform-agnostic components where possible
- Avoid DOM-specific APIs
- Keep styling simple and compatible
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow atomic design principles
- Implement proper error handling
- Use lazy loading for better performance"# AlumniBv1"
