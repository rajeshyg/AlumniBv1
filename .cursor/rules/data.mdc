# application data and data services

- [posts.json](mdc:src/data/posts.json) contains the posts data. Currently we don't have real database. 
- When user creates new post using [PostForm.tsx](mdc:src/components/Posts/PostForm.tsx) it doesn't save to the posts.json file instead caches. We have clear cache button in the [Posts.tsx](mdc:src/pages/Posts.tsx) to reset the cache and load data from posts.json
- Any action done by the user should be saved with the studentId from the users database (currently [users.csv](mdc:public/data/users.csv)) such as likes, posts, comments and etc. In [posts.json](mdc:src/data/posts.json) PostedBy field is foreign key for the current profile(user). For example record "ID": "post-005" in [posts.json](mdc:src/data/posts.json) is posted by studentId 10870 in the [users.csv](mdc:public/data/users.csv). At this point we don't have data integrity in the [posts.json](mdc:src/data/posts.json) file
