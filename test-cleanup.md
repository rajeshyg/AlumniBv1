# Test Cleanup Instructions

The following files should be deleted to fix the test errors:

1. `src/components/Posts/PostsPage.test.tsx` - This was testing a component that we've determined to be a duplicate
2. `src/services/PostService.test.tsx` - This duplicates the functionality in `PostService.test.ts`

## How to Delete

Using the command line:
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd c:\React-Projects\AlumbiBv1

# Remove the files
rm src/components/Posts/PostsPage.test.tsx 
rm src/services/PostService.test.tsx
```

Alternatively, you can delete these files through your file explorer or IDE.

After deleting these files, run the tests again:
```bash
npm test
```

The errors should be resolved and all tests should pass successfully.
